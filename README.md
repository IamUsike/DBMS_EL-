# Real Estate Management System (MERN Stack)

This project is part of our *DBMS lab*, where we are developing a **Real Estate Management System** using the *MERN stack* (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The system aims to streamline the management of real estate properties by providing a robust and user-friendly platform for property listing, management, and interaction.

## Features

*   **User authentication and role-based access control:** Users can create accounts and log in securely. The system implements role-based access control to differentiate between users (e.g., buyers, sellers, admins), granting appropriate permissions based on their role.
*   **Add, edit, and delete property listings:** Authorized users can add new property listings with details such as address, price, description, images, and other relevant information. They can also edit and delete existing listings.
*   **Search and filter properties based on various criteria:** Users can search for properties based on location, price range, property type (e.g., house, apartment, land), number of bedrooms/bathrooms, and other criteria. Filtering options allow users to refine their search results.
*   **Responsive and intuitive user interface:** The user interface is designed to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes, providing a seamless experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
*   **Secure data storage and retrieval using MongoDB:** Data is stored securely in a MongoDB database, ensuring data integrity and efficient retrieval.

## Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** React.js
*   **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
*   **Database:** MongoDB
*   **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
